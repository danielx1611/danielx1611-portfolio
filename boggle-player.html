                        <p>
                            This project was a collaborative effort between my teammate Luka and I, as seen in the BogglePlayer.java file.
                            We worked closely together, continuously bouncing ideas off one another and jointly implementing solutions.
                            Debugging and performance optimization were handled as a team, allowing us to refine our approach through shared
                            problem-solving and iterative improvements.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="project-description-subheader">Context:</h3>
                        <p>

                            Boggle is a word game played on a 4x4 board of random letters. Players form valid words by connecting adjacent
                            letters, with longer words yielding higher scores. Our objective was to create an automated Boggle solver that
                            could achieve the highest possible score in the shortest amount of time.
                            <br /> <br />
                            The competition, held at a class-wide level (~30–40 students), evaluated projects based on three key factors:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Score efficiency:</b> Points earned from the board</li>
                            <li><b>Execution speed:</b> How quickly those points were achieved</li>
                            <li><b>Memory usage:</b> Overall program efficiency</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Our solution produced the highest-scoring and most efficient results in the entire class. By focusing on optimized
                            algorithms and fast data structures, we consistently outperformed all other submissions in both speed and accuracy.
